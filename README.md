# Kindle-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

Dataset - https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#amazon_reviews (Credits for the dataset goes to this site)

In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on Kindle reviews. Techniques like BOW(Bag of Words) and TF-IDF(Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequecy) have been used to extract features from the corpus and are compared for better accuracy. The machine learning model used to perform classification is Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.
